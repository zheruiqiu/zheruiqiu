## About Me

My research focuses on **embodied AI**, **3D reconstruction** and their applications. I am passionate about exploring the unknown and pushing the boundaries of AI and emerging technologies.

- &#x1F3EB; **Ph.D. in Data Science** - University of Science and Technology of China (2020 - Present)
  - I have authored and co-authored 3 papers at the top conferences in the fields of AI and computer graphics.

- &#x1F393; **B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Automation** - Southwest Jiaotong University (2016 - 2020)
  - **National Scholarship** (2016, 2017)
  - **1<sup>st</sup> Prize** - Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (2017)
